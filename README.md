# UFOs - Module 12

## Overview
Here we are using HTML and JS to create a locally hosted webpage to filter UFO data by Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. 

### Data
We started with a JSON file containing roughly 100 UFO sightings. 

### D3 
We use D3 to filter the data found in the file above. We also include a event listener to detect imput on the website. To load D3 we use the following script: 

`<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/4.12.0/d3.js"></script>`

### App
This file contains the JS code that handles the table and filters. 

## Summary

Users can filter data using the fields on the left side of the screenshot below.
